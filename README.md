This project analyzes the energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness of electric vehicles (EVs) from different manufacturers. Using a custom dataset compiled from manufacturer specifications and real-world electricity rates, the analysis explores how factors like efficiency (mi/kWh), vehicle weight, and city-specific electricity prices impact the overall cost per mile. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed that Tesla leads in energy efficiency, while Lucid offers long range with moderate efficiency. Weight was found to negatively impact efficiency. The project used Python tools (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and visualization. Ultimately, Tesla Model 3, Hyundai Kona Electric, and BYD Atto 3 emerged as the most cost-effective EVs across cities.
